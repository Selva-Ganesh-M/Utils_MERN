  format "//g"

    -- a regular expression has to be written inside "//" 2 slashes.
    -- Regular expressions contain a series of characters that define a pattern of text to be matchedâ€”to make a filter more specialized, or general.
    -- g in the regex above shows that the global filter is applied.

    1. Normal  :: Regex = " /a/g "

      -- shows us all the "a" in the text paragraph.
      eg. "R|a|mesh kum|a|r"
     




    2. manual consecutive  ::  Regex = " /aa/g "

      -- shows us all the 2 consecutive "aa" in the text paragraph.
      eg. "aa", "r|aa|vanan"




    3. same consecutive(+)  ::   Regex = " /a+/g "

      -- any number of consective "a" is matched. 
      -- atleast one "a" is matched.
      eg. "aaaaaaa", "aa", "a"





    4. Optional(?)  ::   Regex = " /a?s/g "

      -- "a" is optional, Howover, "s" is must
      eg. "s", "as", "aaaaa|as|"




    5. Optional & Consecutive(* = (+) + (?) )  ::   Regex = " /a*s/g "

     -- "a" is optional, However if present consecutive values is allowed 
     -- "s" is must
     eg. "s", "as", "aas"
